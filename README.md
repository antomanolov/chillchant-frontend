# chillchant-frontend
the front-end of my social media web project.
First I will make the raw HTML/CSS/JS(mockup with icons, and imgs on my local machine only, here on GitHub will be only the code, for now).
When the front-end is finished I will start implementing backend with Django, but I want to keep front and back-end separated for the moment so I can focus on one of them at time.
