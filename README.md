# chillchant-frontend
the front-end of my social media web project.
First I will make the raw HTML/CSS/JS(mockup with icons, and imgs on my local machine only, here on GitHub will be only the code, for now).
When the front-end is finished I will start implementing backend with Django, but I want to keep front and back-end separated for the moment so I can focus on one of them at time.

# When the website is finished will have:
1.Login/logout system. <br/>
2.Message system. <br/>
3.Different modes (dark, light, different font selection etc.) <br/>
4.Fully responsive design. <br/>
5.DB(maybe PostgreSQL) <br/>
6.The option of doing every CRUD operation. <br/>
